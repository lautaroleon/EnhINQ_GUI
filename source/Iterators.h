 * Counts events on a single channel within the time indicated by a “start” and “stop” signals. The bin edges between
 * which counts are accumulated are determined by one or more hardware triggers. Specifically, the measurement records

 * tag is detected on the begin_channel it starts counting tags on the click_channel. When the next tag is detected on
 * the begin_channel it stores the current counter value as the next entry in the data vector, resets the counter to
 * zero and starts accumulating counts again. If an end_channel is specified, the measurement stores the current counter
 * value and resets the counter when a tag is detected on the end_channel rather than the begin_channel. You can use
 * this, e.g., to accumulate counts within a gate by using rising edges on one channel as the begin_channel and falling
 * edges on the same channel as the end_channel. The accumulation time for each value can be accessed via
 * getBinWidths(). The measurement stops when all entries in the data vector are filled.

 * @ingroup TimeHistograms
 * \brief Accumulates the time differences between clicks on two channels in one or more histograms.
 *
 * \image html TimeDifferences.svg
 * \image latex TimeDifferences.pdf
 *
 * A multidimensional histogram measurement with the option up to include three additional channels
 * that control how to step through the indices of the histogram array. This is a very powerful and
 * generic measurement. You can use it to record cross-correlation, lifetime measurements, fluorescence
 * lifetime imaging and many more measurements based on pulsed excitation. Specifically, the measurement
 * waits for a tag on the ‘start_channel’, then measures the time difference between the start tag and
 * all subsequent tags on the ‘click_channel’ and stores them in a histogram. If no ‘start_channel’ is
 * specified, the ‘click_channel’ is used as ‘start_channel’ corresponding to an auto-correlation
 * measurement. The histogram has a number ‘n_bins’ of bins of bin width ‘binwidth’. Clicks that fall
 * outside the histogram range are discarded. Data accumulation is performed independently for all start
 * tags. This type of measurement is frequently referred to as ‘multiple start, multiple stop’
 * measurement and corresponds to a full auto- or cross-correlation measurement.
 *
 * The data obtained from subsequent start tags can be accumulated into the same histogram (one-
 * dimensional measurement) or into different histograms (two-dimensional measurement). In this way, you
 * can perform more general two-dimensional time-difference measurements. The parameter ‘n_histograms’
 * specifies the number of histograms. After each tag on the ‘next_channel’, the histogram index is
 * incremented by one and reset to zero after reaching the last valid index. The measurement starts with
 * the first tag on the ‘next_channel’.
 *
 * You can also provide a synchronization trigger that resets the histogram index by specifying a
 * ‘sync_channel’. The measurement starts when a tag on the ‘sync_channel’ arrives with a subsequent tag
 * on ‘next_channel’. When a rollover occurs, the accumulation is stopped until the next sync and
 * subsequent next signal. A sync signal before a rollover will stop the accumulation, reset the
 * histogram index and a subsequent signal on the ‘next_channel’ starts the accumulation again.
 *
 * Typically, you will run the measurement indefinitely until stopped by the user. However, it is also
 * possible to specify the maximum number of rollovers of the histogram index. In this case the
 * measurement stops when the number of rollovers has reached the specified value. This means that for
 * both a one-dimensional and for a two-dimensional measurement, it will measure until the measurement
 * went through the specified number of rollovers / sync tags.

 *
 * This is a multidimensional implementation of the TimeDifferences measurement class. Please read their documentation
 * first.
 *
 * This measurement class extends the TimeDifferences interface for a multidimensional amount of histograms.
 * It captures many multiple start - multiple stop histograms, but with many asynchronous next_channel triggers.
 * After each tag on each next_channel, the histogram index of the associated dimension is
 * incremented by one and reset to zero after reaching the last valid index.  The elements of the parameter n_histograms
 * specifies the number of histograms per dimension. The accumulation starts when next_channel has been triggered on all
 * dimensions.
 *
 * You should provide a synchronization trigger by specifying a sync_channel per dimension.
 * It will stop the accumulation when an associated histogram index rollover occurs.
 * A sync event will also stop the accumulation, reset the histogram index of the associated dimension,
 * and a subsequent event on the corresponding next_channel starts the accumulation again.
 * The synchronization is done asynchronous, so an event on the next_channel increases the histogram index even if the
 * accumulation is stopped. The accumulation starts when a tag on the sync_channel arrives with a subsequent tag on
 * next_channel for all dimensions.
 *
 * Please use setInputDelay to adjust the latency of all channels. In general, the order of the provided triggers
 * including maximum jitter should be: old start trigger -- all sync triggers -- all next triggers -- new start trigger

 * It calculates the STDD, ADEV, MDEV and HDEV on the fly:

 *         This is not a stable analysis with frequency drifts and only calculated for reference.
 * - ADEV: Overlapping Allan deviation, the most common analysis framework.
 *         Square mean value of the second derivate `phase[i] - 2*phase[i + n] + phase[i + 2*n]`.
 *         In a loglog plot, the slope allows to identify the source of noise:
 *   -        -1: white or flicker phase noise, like discretization or analog noisy delay
 *   -      -0.5: white period noise
 *   -         0: flicker period noise, like electric noisy oscillator
 *   -       0.5: integrated white period noise (random walk period)
 *   -         1: frequency drift, e.g. thermal
 *   .
 *         As this tool is most likely used to analyse timings, a scaled ADEV is implemented.
 *         It adds 1.0 to each slope and normalize the return value to picoseconds for phase noise.
 * - MDEV: Modified overlapping Allan deviation. It averages the second derivate of ADEV before
 *         calculating the MSE. This splits the slope of white and flicker phase noise:
 *   -      -1.5: white phase noise, like discretization
 *   -      -1.0: flicker phase noise, like an electric noisy delay
 *   .
 *         The scaled approach (+1 on each slope yielding picoseconds as return value) is called TDEV and
 *         more commonly used than MDEV.
 * - HDEV: The overlapping Hadamard deviation uses the third derivate of the phase.
 *         This cancels the effect of a constant phase drift.
